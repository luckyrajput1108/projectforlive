<marquee direction="left"; scrollamount="5" align="center"><p><span style="color:yellow">Film, also called movie or motion picture,</span>
  <span style="color:red">is a medium used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories,
    perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along
     with other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema",<span style="color:blue"> short for cinematography, is often used to
     refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. also known
     as films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or
      teach people something.<span style="color:yellow"> People in every part of the world watch movies as a type of entertainment,
      a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean films that make them laugh, while for others
       it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid.
<span style="color:pink">The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera,</span>
  by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and
   computer animation,<span style="color:red"> or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical process and then shown
through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the
entire process of production, distribution, <span style="color:green">and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form
traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and
 other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn,
affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon.The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.
